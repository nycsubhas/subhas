    "Three-Level Namespace Enforcement: UC requires all data to be accessed using the fully qualified name (catalog.schema.table).

    "\n",
    "An External Location is a named, securable object in Unity Catalog that maps a specific, well-defined path in your cloud storage \n",
    "(e.g., an S3 bucket or an ADLS container) to a human-readable identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role: It acts as the \"root\" directory that governs where users and processes can access data outside of UC's managed storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are Storage Credentials?\n",
    "\n",
    "Storage Credentials are also securable objects in Unity Catalog that encapsulate the long-lived, sensitive authentication information needed to access the cloud storage path defined by the External Location.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Role: These credentials typically take the form of an AWS IAM Role, an Azure Service Principal, or a similar cloud entity that provides the necessary read/write permissions to the underlying storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why They are Mandatory for External Tables in UC\n",
    "External Locations and Storage Credentials are mandatory for creating External Tables in Unity Catalog because they enforce the principle of Secure Storage Delegation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mandatory: When you define an External Table, you must reference an existing External Location, which in turn relies on a Storage Credential.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem They Solve: Without them, Databricks would either need to rely on the cluster's broad instance profile (legacy, insecure) or require users to manually input sensitive cloud credentials (unmanageable, insecure).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Security Principle Enforced\n",
    "The primary security principle enforced by this mechanism is Separation of Duties and Least Privilege Access (or Credential Passthrough):\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of Duties: The Metastore Admin creates the secure Storage Credentials. A different user (the Data Engineer) then creates the External Location referencing those credentials. A third user (the Data Analyst) is only granted CREATE TABLE permissions on the External Location, never seeing the underlying sensitive credential.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Least Privilege Access: When a user queries an External Table, UC uses the associated, securely managed Storage Credential (IAM Role/Service Principal) to generate temporary, short-lived tokens that grant the requesting cluster just enough permission to read/write the necessary files. This prevents users and processes from having persistent, broad access to the entire cloud storage bucket.\n",

    "* Direct Cloud Access: When a recipient requests data (e.g., runs a SQL query), the Delta Sharing server (managed by Databricks/UC) \n",

    "\n",
    "* Client-Side Read: The recipient's system (whether it's a Databricks environment, a competitive cloud platform, or an open-source client \n",
    "like Pandas) uses these temporary URLs to read the data files directly from the provider's cloud storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No Copying: Since the recipient reads directly from the source files, there is no need to copy, export, or move the data, saving storage costs, reducing latency, and ensuring the recipient always sees the most up-to-date version of the Delta table.\n",
    "\n",
